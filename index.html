               <h2>“EXPLORE TOGETHER”</h2>
                <p>Come join us at the Stockholm Science Museum where we are committed to making science accessible to  all.
                Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind,  water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life  itself.
                The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our  discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

                   <p>
                    On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It is a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
