## Project Description

The **Stockholm Science Museum** aims to engage children aged 7-15 and their families through an interactive and informative web experience. The goal of the project is to design and develop a modern, accessible, and responsive website that provides key information about the museum and encourages people to visit. The site was built using only **HTML** and **CSS** without any JavaScript, following the project's guidelines.

The website features a user-friendly design, with sections tailored for children and families without being overly childish. It also adheres to accessibility standards to accommodate a wide range of users.

## User Stories

The website fulfills the following user stories:
- A visitor can view a **Home Page** showing key information and impactful imagery.
- A visitor can view a **Contact Page** showing the museum's address, phone number, opening hours, and a contact form.
- A visitor can view a **Contribution Page** showing information on how to contribute to the museum.
- A visitor can view an **Exhibitions Page** showcasing upcoming events and available exhibitions.
- A visitor can view a **Privacy Policy** and **Terms & Conditions** on a dedicated **Document Page**.
